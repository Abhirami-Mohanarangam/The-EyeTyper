# The-EyeTyper
Download [Face shape predictor](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android/blob/master/data/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) and put it in the same directory where you have stored [TheEyeTyper.py](https://github.com/abhi-1103/The-EyeTyper/blob/main/TheEyeTyper.py) file
 
This project was done with the only purpose to detect the eyes, their gaze and the blinking.

The app will be built in 2 main parts.
  
  Eye detection: Detection of the eyes, their movement and most important their blinking.
  
  Typer: A keyboard on the screen where weâ€™re going to select the letters by just using our eyes.

A few parts regarding the eye detection have been hardcoded to work specifically with my eyes and with a specific lightening condition and with a certain webcam.
This means that if some of these thress variables is different for you, the code might not work properly or might not work at all.
