# The-EyeTyper
Download [Face shape predictor](https://github.com/tzutalin/dlib-android/blob/master/data/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) and put it in the same directory where you have stored [TheEyeTyper.py](https://github.com/abhi-1103/The-EyeTyper/blob/main/TheEyeTyper.py) file
 
This project was realised with the only purpose to teach you how to detect the eyes, theyr gaze and the blinking.

A few parts regarding the eye detection have been hardcoded to work specifically with my eyes and with a specific lightening condition and with a certain webcam.
This means that if some of these thress variables is different for you, the code might not work properly or might not work at all.

It’s of course possible to improve it for production environment.
If you’re the owner of a company and you want to develop this project further, feel free to contact me.
